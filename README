Web To Kindle
-------------

A crude hack to scrape html pages off the web and email it to the kindle (or just about any email address) as an attachment.

Google App Engine:

1. Listens to HTTP GET requests 
2. Does a URL fetch of the given url 
3. Sends the page as an attachment to the given email address
4. Sender will be the gmail id of the user who sent the get request , may redirect to a google login page if required

JS Bookmarklet:

1. To grab the current URL , prompt for email address 
2. Send HTTP GET request to the app engine instance.

NOTE:
This was a couple hours hack, could definitely do *much* better. Mail suggestions to me AT jaskirat DOT info
